## About
Here you will find all the documentation Iâ€™ve created for the technology I use. I currently use Windows & Linux as main drivers, so most of the documentation will not be platform agnostic, though occasionally, I may include macOS-related content. Keep in mind that most cases are WIP. All documents are created using Markdown.

You are welcome to clone my repositories, & modify and distribute the source code as you please, given that you stick to GNU GPL v3 standards. Please refer to the repo [License](https://github.com/pabloaguirrenck/documentation/blob/master/LICENSE) if you have any questions regarding licensing.
