## About
Here you will find all the documentation Iâ€™ve created for the technology I use. I currently use Windows & Linux as main drivers, so most of the documentation will not be platform agnostic, though occasionally, I may include macOS-related content. Keep in mind that most cases are WIP. All documents are created using Markdown.
